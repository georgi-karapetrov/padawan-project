The **Padawan Project** is a teacher constructed program, which aims to bring
students to a level equal of a Junior Javascript Front-end Developer, through
task-based approach and self-learning.

## Why?
Knowledge is useless, unless applied. The web holds vast amount of data,
however, we as human beings are severely limited by the amount one can learn for
the time given. Naturally we want to make the process as effecient as
possible.
This course does not aim to give a complete reference to the language,
but rather give introduction into the world of JS and the necessary skills to
learn on your own.

All of this is achieved without cluttering the mind with theory and language specifics, which will not be of any use for the person at this point of his education. That being said, initially many of the tasks will be perfomed blindly, without delving deeply into what the language constructs actually mean. With each task, the pupil will understand more and more of how things actually work.

## Prerequisites
The program, _MUST_ be undertaken with a mentor.

This program is **NOT** meant for people to learn by themselves!

No computer science knowledge is needed beforehand.

Absolute student and mentor motivation is necessary. Do not start it, if you
intend not to finish it.

Each mentor is advised to pick his own motivation system, so he can keep the
program interesting. A sample badge "reward" system is proposed.

## Additional notes
This project will always be free.

All the necessary reading materials also have markdown version in their
respective folder under `cached`, in case a site goes down.

Please try to improve the documents as much as possible, and share your
experiences via PRs or email at: mihaildono@gmail.com
