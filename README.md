Teacher constructed program, which aims to bring students to a level equal of Javascript Frontend Junior Developer.

## Why?
Knowledge is useless, unless applied. The web holds vast amount of data, however, we as human beings are severely limited by the amount one can learn for the time given. Naturally we want to make the process as effecient as possible. This course does not aim to give a complete reference to the language, but rather give introduction into the world of JS. All of this is achieved without cluttering the mind with theory and language specifics, which will not be of any use for the person at this point of his education. That being said initially many of the tasks will be perfomed blindly, without delving deeply into what the language constructs actually mean. With each task, the pupil will understand more and more of how things actually work.

## Prerequisited
The program, _MUST_ be undertaken with a mentor.

This program is **NOT** meant for people, to learn by themselves!

No computer science knowledge is needed beforehand.

Student and mentor motivation is free. Do not start it, if you intend not to finish it.

## Additional notes
This project will always be free.
