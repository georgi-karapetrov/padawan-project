The **Padawan Project** is a collection of curated learning programs, utilizing specific
set of peer reviewed research backed tools, which allows anyone to consistently
and effectively educate themselves.

## Why?
There are many different education systems in the world, some more effective than
others. This inconsistency is staggering, considering there is plenty of research
that supports optimal learning methods. Furthermore accessibility of information
nowadays allows for everyone to get **equal** opportunity to develop regardless of
their social and economic status, as well as their geolocation. The mission of this
project is to bring a system that defines a clear development path and explicit
use of necessary techniques to achieve that. Our vision is a world where knowledge
is a basic right and anyone has equal success in it.

## Prerequisites
The program: <br>
_MUST_ be undertaken with a mentor. <br>
Is **NOT** meant for people to learn by themselves!

No prior knowledge is needed beforehand.

Mentor should have 5+ years of experience in the domain and 2+ years of experience
working in soft-skill intensive environment.
NOTE: exact experience is TBD

## Programs
[Front End Web Development][JS]

## Mentor Information
Ideally each group should consist of 2-4 people. As it is important for the students
to feel the sense of community, but not so much that the teacher is overwhelmed by
too many people.
NOTE: See research regarding optimal class size

The whole program should be led by a *single* mentor, as to minimize the impact
of context switching for students, however it is recommended to have occasional
lectures with different lectors on more laid back topics, that are still
informative(eg. basic UX, history of web)

No outside remarks should be made unless requests by the mentor. There is an
ongoing problem of different teachers/parents/students interfering with the work
of a teacher, thus disturbing the process. Throughout the program there should be
scheduled meetings where people outside of the group can submit their appeals and
have discussion with the mentors.

**MENTORS** should first visit the [teacher manual][teacher-manual]

## Principles
This program tries to stay as close as possible to the [Zone of proximal development][zone],
to maximize the efficiency of learning.
Tasks should be constructed in [85% success rule][fail]
Take into account the 5 stages of [Tuckman][Tuckman] Team Model to monitor team chemistry

## Class notes
Teaching should begin not too early, so that the individual is completely awake(10 am would be ideal).
Study day should not exceed 6 hours.
Sessions should be according to [Ultradian][Ultradian] rhythm
It is also advised to use the [Pomodoro][pomodoro] technique as well to utilize deep work
as much as possible.
Each session should be a maximum of 1.5 hours divided in 3 pomodoros.
There should be regular multi-person projects that promote cooperation.
There should be regularly contests to train for real life scenarios and deadlines.

## Group Chemistry
NOTE: Here we can put more suggestion how to improve team chemistry
At regular intervals there should be organized teambuildings(search for proper research)
- hackaton
- cross-group competitions
- non-subject activities(karaoke, escape room, festival, cinema...)

## Badges and rewards
The program will make use of the [Random intermittent reward][reward] research.
Rewards should be mainly given at random intervals. Big and scheduled rewards
should be given only at big milestones(eg. completing the program)

| Name          | Description           | Reward    |
| Completionist | Solve 50 tasks        |           |
| Lootbox       | Random Daily reward   | Candy bar |
| Bullseye      | Center an element     |           |
| Loop Hero     | Loop through an array |           |
| Jedi          | Finish the program    | Party     |

## Research
Everything in this program should be backed with research. All of the related papers
will be stored [here][research]

## Roadmap
- Customized learning materials that contributing to the final
objective
- Mentor Network
- Sponsoring(Donations, NFT, state subsidies)
- Blockchain reward system
- Additional subjects

## Additional notes
**This project will always be free.**
