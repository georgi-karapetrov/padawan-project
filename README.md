The **Padawan Project** is a minimalistic teacher constructed program, which provides
people with the necessary skills to work as javascript developers. This is
achieved through mentorship, self-learning, problem solving and applicaiton building.

## Why?
Knowledge is useless, unless applied. The web holds vast amount of data,
however, we as human beings are severely limited by the amount one can learn for
the time given. Naturally we want to make the process as effecient as
possible.
This course does not aim to give a complete reference to the language,
but rather give introduction into the world of JS and the necessary skills to
learn on your own.

All of this is achieved without cluttering the mind with theory and language
specifics, which will not be of any use for the person at this point of his
education. That being said, initially many of the tasks will be perfomed blindly,
without delving deeply into what the language constructs actually mean. With each
task, the pupil will understand more and more of how things actually work.

## Prerequisites
The program: <br>
    _MUST_ be undertaken with a mentor. <br>
    is **NOT** meant for people to learn by themselves!

No computer science knowledge is needed beforehand.

Absolute student and mentor motivation is necessary. Do not start it, if you
intend not to finish it.

## Overview
The program is divided into 3 parts:
- [Youngling][youngling], is the where everyone should begin. It teaches you
  about the basics of the language and introduces the students to algorithmic
  thinking
- [Padawan][padawan], throws you into the real world of javascript
  development. You will create different projects and acquire all the necessary
  skills to service
- [Jedi][jedi], gives you the opportunity to test your skills and add an amazing
  project to your portfolio
- [Epilogue][epilogue], prepares you for the interview process

## Principles
This program tries to stay as close as possible to the [Zone of proximal development][zone],
to maximize the efficiency of learning.
It is also advised to use the [Pomodoro][pomodoro] technique as well to utilize deep work
as much as possible. Furthermore, practice Getting Things Done (GTD) methodology of planning
the day before and keeping Todo lists.

## Badges
Each mentor is advised to pick his own motivation system, so he can keep the
program interesting.

The program has sample reward system and badges that can be earned. Try to
achieve as much as possible to experience all the benefits of this course.
