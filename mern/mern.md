## Introduction

Usually an application is a combination of different building blocks. This
course is focused on front-end development, however in order to become good at
this, one must also delve into the back-end as well.

In this chapter we will learn about the MERN(MongoDB, Express JS, React JS and
Node JS) stack and basics of back-end development: endpoints, databases, queries and
deployment.
