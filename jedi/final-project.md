It is time to put it all together and create a project that is worthy to be put
in your portfolio.

## Ultimate Trial
Snake game engine created in javascript. You can decide what you want to
implement. There can be multiple apples, with special properties and different
stats, the snake can teleport around the board when reaching a border or keep it
classic style. There can be even different modes, where the user can switch
between- be creative!

The front-end should use react and any visualization library.

Websockets should to establish continuous connection for movement, and REST for all
other kinds of data transfer.

User should be able to login via google/facebook and registration.

Global scoreboard showing top 10 users.

Should be deployed to AWS.

The whole application should have unit and integration tests.
