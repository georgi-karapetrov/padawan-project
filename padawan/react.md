# Introduction
Previously, we learned about the `individual` elements that make a
web page. Time to bring them together. Now we will learn about
`React`. `React` is a library, that makes building SPAs(Single Page
Application) very easy.

If a person strives to be good at his job, he is expected to continuously
learn new things and expand his knowledge. That being said, one should learn
to look at a lot of documentation, tutorials and posts and as quickly as
possible to absorb the needed knowledge for the task.

Complete the following [tutorial][tutorial].

## Trial
1. TODO list
List all of the created todos in a list.
You should be able to add, remove and update a task.
Todos can be reordered. To achieve this use a library of your liking.
Split the jsx code into 2 subfunctions - TaskList and Task.

BONUS: create your own drag-n-drop reorder to earn the badge "Showoff"

2. Employee list
List first 10 employees from this api:
`http://dummy.restapiexample.com/api/v1/employees`
Create a function that sorts by random employee attribute(salary, name...) every
10 seconds

3. Routing
Combine Todo and Employee in new app with Home as a landing page - use
ReactRouter

## Final Trial
Implement the snake game with canvas and react!

Continuing the previous project, we will use the same js engine from the
previous chapter and finally build the front-end.

Complete this section to earn the badge "reactive"

When finished with the trial, head over to the [mern][mern] section for
introduction to backend and the MERN stack.
