1. When having curriculum with multiple subjects,
create a program that is consistent and is rotating
subjects that require more concentration with those that are
more relaxed.
- rotate physical with mental -> PE, math, music, physics?
2. There shouldnt be too long school break, like summer school break - 3 months.
This breaks student concentration. Japanese school system looks like a good alternative
to have 3 semesters, with maybe 2-3 1 month max breaks.
- Potential idea is to organize summer and winter camps that promote seasonal activities
This should be incorporated with Scandinavian school methods, to gradually increase homework,
to allow children to develop personal interests.
