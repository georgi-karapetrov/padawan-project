# Introduction
Often overlooked by developers, creating good reusable and responsive layouts is going to be
one of the main tasks, that a front-end developer will be performing.

For a simple overview of how to approach creating beautiful pages, open howto-css.md.

At this state to style an element use classes. We will use ids and global tag
stylings in the next chapter.

`bad`

```css
p {
    font-size: 8px;
}

#header {
    color: red;
}
```

`good`

```css
.header {
    font-size: 8px;
    color: red;
}
```
